## Tools
### Tools which makes everything easier (and possible)
First things first
- [ConEmu replacing CMD on Windows](https://conemu.github.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

See also [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

#### IDEs
Wikipedia on IDE: An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

# More to learn
## The Basics of Operating Systems
It may sound stupid, but many people lacks the basics of Windows. It seems to be an intuitively designed software, but it is and remains a very complex piece of software. Therefore, in order to facilitate the daily work as a software developer, please PLEASE learn the basics of at least Windows, or even better of other systems like Linux.

- [Linux](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners)

## Embedded Systems
Your desktop computer (PC, Mac) or Notebook is a good working device? But you can develop software for smaller devices too. Learn some of the basics of Raspberry Pi and even smaller, the embedded microcontroller Arduino. This will help you to cope with typical problems of reduced resources in embedded environment. Plus you have the opportunity to apply your programming skills and create a useful application.
