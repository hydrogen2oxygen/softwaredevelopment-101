This "[web-ring](https://www.learnpython.org/)" explains most parts of programming aspects, from variables to object oriented programming, for these languages: 

    Python
    Java
    HTML
    Go
    C
    C++
    JavaScript
    PHP
    Shell
    C#
    Perl
    Ruby
    Scala
    SQL

### Programming Languages
Different programming languages have their pros and cons. Just learn the basics of 3 to 5 different languages will help you to cope better with the syntax and typical flow of programming.

- [Python Basics](https://realpython.com/python-basics/)
- [Java Basics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-hello-world)
- [PHP](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_introduction.htm)
- [GO](https://golang.org/)

### Data Storage and Transfer
Wikipedia on [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol): In telecommunication, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity.

- What is [TCP/IP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpsEaqJV_A0)?
- What is [HTTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eesqK59rhGA)?
- What is a [Web-Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhpUch6lWMw)?

The format how data can be transfered:

- [XML and JSON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqROpUNb2aY)

SQL Database

-Install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [learn](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) how to use it!

## Tools
### Tools which makes everything easier (and possible)
First things first
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), because Windows don't know what a real notepad should be like
- [ConEmu replacing CMD on Windows](https://conemu.github.io/), because Windows CMD shell is the worst on our planet
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), because we want to develop for open source

See also [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and this [great video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-).

#### IDEs
Wikipedia on IDE: An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)

#### Build Tools
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), a build tool for Java (or even PHP and other languages, if you know how to use it)

#### Other Tools
- [Insomnia Rest Client](https://insomnia.rest/download/)

### SDKs
A SDK is a Software Development Kit, which is usually provided for most programming languages

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PHP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

# More to learn

Take also a look at the [video tutorial](VIDEO-TUTORIALS.md).

## The Basics of Operating Systems
It may sound stupid, but many people lacks the basics of Windows. It seems to be an intuitively designed software, but it is and remains a very complex piece of software. Therefore, in order to facilitate the daily work as a software developer, please PLEASE learn the basics of at least Windows, or even better of other systems like Linux.

- [Windows Basics](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/)
- [Linux](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners)

## Embedded Systems
Your desktop computer (PC, Mac) or Notebook is a good working device? But you can develop software for smaller devices too. Learn some of the basics of Raspberry Pi and even smaller, the embedded microcontroller Arduino. This will help you to cope with typical problems of reduced resources in embedded environment. Plus you have the opportunity to apply your programming skills and create a useful application.

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

## Logic Simulation
- [Circuit Verse](https://circuitverse.org/users/7315/projects/20305)

## Advanced stuff
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
